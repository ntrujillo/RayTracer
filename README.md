# RayTracer

Constructed a complete ray tracer for static rendered objects using openGL and C++. Implemented a bounding box for object file rendering to increase performance of ray tracer.

Navigate to build folder and run ./ray to show the static scene rendgered using ray tracing. run ./ray bunny to render the bunny obj file using a bounding box *note this process takes some time since there is a performance bug in this implementation*
